TODO
=======================

FormationUI
-----------------
add buttons for destination and facing

make the data text directly editable

Need to prevent clicks on UI from affecting gamescene
    Having gamescene only "active" when instructed from the UI is a very clunky way to do it. Need to figure out how to have UI interactives suppress events flowing through to GS (this may just be default Heaps behaviour, need to test by having units be interactives)

Direct Formation Control
-----------------
make an interactive, have it control positioning and facing. Have a ghost to indicate future positioning

Have a direct mouse based way to change row\column parameters?

Need to have a more clever assignment of units to positions. Pathfinding\distance based


Notes on dynamics
-----------------
If a unit is too disordered (far from where it's meant to be in formation), it should lose track of where it's meant to be. Especially if morale is impacted.
Enough disordered units near each other should break from formation completely. Enough of these together, and not under threat, may be able to reform.

Need to calculate the maximum turn rate for a formation of a given width and units of given top speed. Or, y'know, just let the player figure it out.

How to reorder units naturally? Feels like rows should fill from the back, and units removed from columns should form new rows at the back.

Completed
=======================
MVP
-----------------
Have units moving about in formation
Be able to dynamically change formation

FormationUI
-----------------
make whole UI draggable
    need to prevent it from being dragged off-screen
make the layout pretty (kinda)
Automatically have minimum width\height for all flows be equal to the largest, to preserve the grid layout
have holding down mouse repeat button activation
